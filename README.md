## :computer: Demo

[Live demo]()

## :bulb: Concept

This web app fits the following user story: _'As a foodie, I want to be able to scan a product while shopping so that I can read more information about the product and make a good choice whether it fits my diet.'_
So the app makes it easier for the user to find out if a product contains something they are allergic to. They scan the barcode of the product and the information of the product comes forward. When the user doesn't have internet, a custom offline page will be displayed.

## :high_brightness: Features

* Scan a product -> get information about that product
* Search a product with the barcode -> get information about that product
* When barcode is not found -> given feedback that it's not found
* Offline page with information

## :clipboard: Assessment

In this course we convert the client side web application, made during the Web App From Scratch course, into a server side rendered application. We also add functionalities based on the Service Worker and turn the application into a Progressive Web App. Finally we’ll implement a series of optimisations to improve the performance of the application.
